# Collapse-Timescale
 
Code to produce data and figures for "Timescales of Ice Shelf Collapse via Crevassing" by Bradley, Coffey and Lai. 

## Generating Data
Scripts to generate the data are contained in the '/gendata' folder. Note that in order to run these files, the circum Antarctic data must first be downloaded from Zenodo (coming soon). The processed data files produced by these scripts can alternatively be downloaded from the same Zenodo repository.

## Making Figures
Figures contained in the paper can be produced by running the corresponding "make_figureX.m" file.

## Getting Help
